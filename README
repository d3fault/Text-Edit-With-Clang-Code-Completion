Text Edit with Clang Code Completion

Pretty self-explanatory. Took a bunch of code from a Clang code completion example ( https://gist.github.com/Rip-Rip/758615 ) and the "Custom Completer" example that comes with Qt. Tried to keep it short and sweet by skipping lots of unnecessary bits in the custom completer example.

Qt + Clang = <3


Tested on Debian Jessie

PREREQUISITES

Of course you need Qt dev packages installed.

For libclang:
# apt-get install libclang-dev llvm-dev

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Clone this repo and cd into it as normal user, then:

$ qmake
$ make

KNOWN ISSUES

Completion fails with the following one liner:
struct x { void y() { } }; static void a() x x1; x1. }
If you put your cursor after the "x1." and press ctrl+space, nothing happens (it should show auto-completion for y). The workaround is to move the very last closing curly brace onto the line below. I have no idea why this happens, if anyone does please let me know.
